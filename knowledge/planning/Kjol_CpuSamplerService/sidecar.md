## Grilling & Discussion

### General code organization in Kjol/CpuSamplerService.swift

**Current code (Kjol/CpuSamplerService.swift (general review)):**

```swift
// See: Kjol/CpuSamplerService.swift
```

**A)** Keep CpuSamplerService as-is — it has clear responsibilities and follows Swift conventions.
**B)** Refactor CpuSamplerService into smaller focused types — improves testability and separation of concerns.
**C)** Extract shared utilities from CpuSamplerService into a common module — reduces duplication if patterns appear elsewhere.

**Recommendation:** A — Keep CpuSamplerService as-is — it has clear responsibilities and follows Swift conventions.

**Reviewer:** I agree with keeping CpuSamplerService as-is.
**Verdict:** Agree
**Reasoning:** The sampler has a focused single responsibility—collecting P/E core samples—and adding indirection for a small service type would hurt readability. Without evidence of testing pain or duplication, splitting now is speculative.
**Risk:** If CPU sampling requirements grow later, the file may become a maintenance bottleneck and require structural change anyway.

### Secondary design concern in Kjol/CpuSamplerService.swift

**Current code (Kjol/CpuSamplerService.swift (secondary review)):**

```swift
// See: Kjol/CpuSamplerService.swift
```

**A)** Keep CpuSamplerService as-is — the secondary concern is minor.
**B)** Refactor CpuSamplerService to address the secondary concern — improves robustness.
**C)** Extract and document the secondary concern as a known limitation.

**Recommendation:** A — Keep CpuSamplerService as-is — the secondary concern is minor.
