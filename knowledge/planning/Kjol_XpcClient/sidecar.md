## Grilling & Discussion

### Sync XPC API blocking pattern in Kjol/XpcClient.swift

**Current code (XpcClient.swift, syncSetAlwaysOn() lines 79-86: DispatchSemaphore with 2.0s timeout):**

```swift
// See: Kjol/XpcClient.swift
```

**A)** Keep the sync wrapper with DispatchSemaphore — it's needed for synchronous calls where the caller can't use async, and the 2s timeout provides a reasonable safety bound.
**B)** Remove syncSetAlwaysOn entirely — force all callers to use the async path, eliminating the sync bridge complexity and potential semaphore deadlock risks.
**C)** Replace semaphore with a dedicated sync dispatch queue and XPC reply handler — cleaner separation but still synchronous.

**Recommendation:** A — Keep the sync wrapper with DispatchSemaphore — it's needed for synchronous calls where the caller can't use async, and the 2s timeout provides a reasonable safety bound.
**Reviewer:** Hermes Agent
**Verdict:** Partially agree
**Reasoning:** Option A is pragmatic for callers that genuinely cannot use async, and the 2s timeout is a sensible safety bound. However, there is no discussion of exception-safe cancellation, so the risk analysis is incomplete.
**Risk:** If the semaphore timeout is hit without explicit error propagation, the caller may proceed on a stale/default state rather than surfacing the failure.

### Lock serialization in async context in Kjol/XpcClient.swift

**Current code (Kjol/XpcClient.swift: NSLock usage for stateCache / connection protection):**

```swift
// See: Kjol/XpcClient.swift
```

**A)** Keep NSLock for synchronous critical sections in XpcClient — NSLock is safe for short critical sections and doesn't interact with Swift's cooperative threading model.
**B)** Replace NSLock with os.unfairlock or actor isolation — actors provide better async-safety guarantees, NSLock can deadlock in Swift concurrency contexts.
**C)** Use DispatchQueue(label:).async for all state mutations — avoids locks entirely but serializes all access.

**Recommendation:** A — Keep NSLock for synchronous critical sections in XpcClient — NSLock is safe for short critical sections and doesn't interact with Swift's cooperative threading model.

**Reviewer:** Hermes Agent
**Verdict:** Agree
**Reasoning:** NSLock remains appropriate here because the critical sections in XpcClient are short and synchronous; Swift Concurrency's cooperative threading model does not directly interact with pthread locks, and introducing actors would add unneeded complexity for this scope.
**Risk:** If any future work incorrectly moves these NSLock-guarded sections into an async context, deadlocks can emerge and require mitigation via os_unfair_lock or isolation boundary changes.
